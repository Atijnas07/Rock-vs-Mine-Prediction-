# Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project builds a Machine Learning model to classify whether an object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** based on sonar signal data. The sonar signals bounce back from the object and are used as input features to predict the type of object.

## üìù Project Description

The dataset contains sonar readings bounced off various surfaces. The goal is to train a supervised learning model to distinguish between rocks (natural underwater objects) and mines (man-made underwater objects). 

This kind of prediction system can be crucial for:
- Submarine operations
- Naval mine detection
- Underwater exploration

The project covers:
- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building using Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation and Prediction
- Deployment-ready code structure
